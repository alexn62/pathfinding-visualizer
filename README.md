### Pathfinding Visualizer

A Dijkstra and A-* pathfinding visualizer implemented in React and JavaScript.

The two algorithms both have their advatages and disadvantages. While Dijkstra guarantees the shortest path through weighted edges, A-Star will find a target node the fastest. However, the key difference lays in the fact that A-Star relies on knowing the exact position of the target node before exploring possible paths.
